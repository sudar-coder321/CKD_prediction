# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction
This is an app for detecting whether the person has chronic disease or not based on input data taken from web UI and passing to Django sq3lite database in backend

The Input Data Constititued of 

In this App various methods such as Random Forest Classfifer and K nearest Neighbours have been compared to decide which give better accuracy.

It was found that Random Forest Classifier Algorithm with the numebr if trees increased to 41 performed better on the data compared to KNN classifier.
