# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction
This is an app for detecting whether the person has chronic disease or not using Classification Algorithms based on input data taken from web UI and passing to Django sq3lite database in backend

The Input Data Constititued of factors such as Blood Glucose Random ,Blood Urea ,Serum Creatine , Packed Cell Volume and White Blood Count

In this App various methods such as Random Forest Classfifer and K nearest Neighbours have been compared to decide which give better accuracy.

It was found that Random Forest Classifier Algorithm with the numebr if trees increased to 41 performed better on the data compared to KNN classifier.


## Output of the project
  
  Changes Dynamically on each execution using a library called SHAP.initJS and a force_plot is used to demonstrate the working of the prediction system.
